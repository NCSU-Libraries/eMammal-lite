      <p class="body-text">
        eMammal Lite contains over 5,000 camera trap images from research projects around the world that are a part of the larger eMammal camera trapping project. Each of these photos help scientists and conservationists document wildlife that may otherwise go unseen. While taking a photo with a camera trap is easily done with modern technical hardware, it is up to a human to provide the actual identification of what tripped the camera. It takes a lot of time and effort for researchers to analyze and identify each photo from a project. eMammal Lite asks you to sit in the place of a researcher to identify actual photos of animals from your backyard to exotic locales. See how well you know your wildlife, you're likely to see an animal you didn't know existed.

    </div>
    <div class="learn-more-body">
      <p class="body-text">
        eMammal is a tool used by researchers to manage their camera trap data, and each project is responsible for providing and managing their own camera traps. Some of these projects have cameras traps to loan out to volunteers within their study area.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sm-header oblique-text">What is a Camera Trap?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        A camera trap is a remotely activated camera that is equipped with a motion sensor or an infrared sensor, or uses a light beam as a trigger. Camera trapping is a method for capturing wild animals on film when researchers are not present, and has been used in ecological research for decades.

      <h2 class="xl-header bold-text">Get Involved</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        eMammal is composed of different research projects and some of these projects recruit volunteers to place cameras while other projects use hired staff.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sm-header oblique-text">Who can participate?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        We encourage anyone who is interested in camera trapping to volunteer if there is an existing project in their area. The active citizen science projects available on the eMammal website.
